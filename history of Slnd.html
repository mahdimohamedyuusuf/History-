 <h1> SOAMALILAND</h1>
 <p>Somaliland's history as a distinct region of Somalia dates back to the late 1800s. The territory was a British protectorate until 1960, when it unified with the rest of present-day Somalia, which had been under Italian rule.Feb 1, 2018</p>
 <p>Somaliland,[a] officially the Republic of Somaliland,[b] is a de facto sovereign state in the Horn of Africa, still considered internationally to be part of Somalia.[8][9][10] Somaliland lies in the Horn of Africa, on the southern coast of the Gulf of Aden. It is bordered by Djibouti to the northwest, Ethiopia to the south and west, and Somalia to the east.[11][12][13][14] Its claimed territory has an area of 176,120 square kilometres (68,000 sq mi),[15] with approximately 5.7 million residents as of 2021.[6] The capital and largest city is Hargeisa. The government of Somaliland regards itself as the successor state to British Somaliland, which, as the briefly independent State of Somaliland, united in 1960 with the Trust Territory of Somaliland (the former Italian Somaliland) to form the Somali Republic.[16]</p>
<p>Somaliland was first inhabited around 10,000 years ago during the Neolithic age.[17][18] The ancient shepherds raised cows and other livestock and it has the most vibrant rock art paintings in Africa. Throughout the Middle Ages, Arab immigrants arrived in Somaliland, including the Muslim sheikhs Ishaaq bin Ahmed, who founded the Isaaq clan, and Abdirahman bin Isma'il al-Jabarti who founded the Darod clan, who both travelled from Arabia to Somaliland and married into the local Dir clan,[19] which have been described as legendary stories.[20] Also during the Middle Ages, Somali empires dominated the regional trade, including the Sultanate of Ifat and the Adal Sultanate.</p>

<h1>British Somaliland</h1>
<p>British Somaliland, officially the Somaliland Protectorate[2] (Somali: Dhulka Maxmiyada Soomaalida ee Biritishka), was a British protectorate in present-day Somaliland. During its existence, the territory was bordered by Italian Somalia, French Somali Coast and Abyssinia (temporarily Italian Ethiopia). From 1940 to 1941, it was occupied by the Italians and was part of Italian East Africa.

    On 26 June 1960, British Somaliland declared independence as the State of Somaliland. Five days later, on 1 July 1960, the State of Somaliland voluntarily united with the Trust Territory of Somalia (the former Italian Somalia) to form the Somali Republic.[3][4] The government of Somaliland, a self-declared sovereign state that is internationally recognised as an autonomous region of Somalia,[5][6] regards itself as the successor state to British Somaliland.[7][8]</p>

    <h1>Somaliland independence</h1>
    <p>On 26 June 1960, British Somaliland gained independence as the State of Somaliland. On 1 July, the country united with the former Italian Somaliland to become the Somali Republic. The anniversaries of both events are now celebrated as public holidays in Somaliland and Somalia.[2]

        On 18 May 1991, a revived Republic of Somaliland "reaffirmed" sovereignty over State of Somaliland[4] from the Somali Democratic Republic. Since 1991, Somaliland has been a self-declared sovereign state that is recognised as an autonomous independent region of Somalia by the international community. Its government regards its territory as the successor state to the State of Somaliland, and seeks full international recognition as the Republic of Somaliland.Wrote by Kawlo [5]</p>
